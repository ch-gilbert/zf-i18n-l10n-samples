# Zend Framework - Internationalization and Localization Samples
====================

This project was created to store and show samples of the Zend Framework Internationalization and Localization article. It has some samples of how to use **Zend_Locale** and **Zend_Translate** as standalone components and how to integrate them in a Zend Framework MVC application.

Two ways were implemented to make this integration:

* The first way is storing the locale information in the PHP session;
* The second way is through the routes, defining the language.
